# AI-Powered FinOps Cost Anomaly Detection

## 📌 Problem
Startups often realize too late that their spending is increasing and their runway is shrinking.
Cloud costs, SaaS tools, and marketing spend can quietly grow month by month without triggering
any clear warning.

Founders need an early signal when spending becomes unusual — before it becomes dangerous.

---

## 💡 Solution
This project implements an AI-powered FinOps system that learns normal startup spending behavior
and automatically detects unusual cost anomalies.  
Instead of just showing numbers, it explains *why* a spike happened in plain English.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Monthly burn rate calculation
- Cost trend visualization over time
- Automatic detection of unusual spending months
- Human-readable AI explanations for cost anomalies

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Load monthly startup expense data (cloud, SaaS, marketing)
2. Learn normal spending patterns from historical data
3. Detect months where total costs deviate significantly from normal behavior
4. Generate clear explanations by comparing anomalies with recent spending averages
