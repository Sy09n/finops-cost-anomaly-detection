# AI-Powered FinOps Cost Anomaly Detection

## 📌 Problem
Startups often realize too late that their spending is increasing and their runway is shrinking.
Cloud costs, SaaS tools, and marketing spend can quietly grow month by month without clear warnings.

Founders need an early signal when spending becomes unusual — before it becomes dangerous.

---

## 💡 Solution
This project builds an AI-powered FinOps system that learns normal startup spending behavior
and automatically detects unusual cost anomalies.

Instead of just showing numbers, the system explains why a cost spike happened in
clear, human-readable language.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Monthly burn rate calculation
- Cost trend visualization
- Automatic cost anomaly detection
- Plain-English AI explanations for spending spikes

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Load monthly startup expense data (cloud, SaaS, marketing)
2. Learn normal spending patterns from historical data
3. Detect months with unusually high total costs
4. Explain anomalies by comparing them to recent spending averages

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Statistical anomaly detection

---

## 📊 Example Insight
In 2023-04, total costs increased by 67.6% compared to the previous 3-month average.


This explanation helps founders immediately understand when and how spending changed,
without digging through raw numbers.

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure `startup_costs.csv` is in the same folder as the Python file
3. Run the script:

```bash
python finops_step2.py

🎯 Why This Project Matters

Most beginner ML projects focus on generic problems like stock prediction or fraud detection.
This project targets a real startup finance problem that founders actually care about.

It demonstrates how AI can help startups monitor burn rate, detect hidden cost leaks,
and receive early financial warnings before runway is impacted.
