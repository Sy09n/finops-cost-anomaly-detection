# AI-Powered FinOps Cost Anomaly Detection

## 📌 Problem
Startups often realize too late that their spending is increasing and their runway is shrinking.
Cloud costs, SaaS tools, and marketing spend can quietly grow month by month without clear warnings.

Founders need an early signal when spending becomes unusual — before it becomes dangerous.

---

## 💡 Solution
This project builds an AI-powered FinOps system that learns normal startup spending behavior
and automatically detects unusual cost anomalies with clear, human-readable explanations.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Monthly burn rate calculation
- Cost trend visualization
- Automatic cost anomaly detection
- Plain-English AI explanations for spending spikes

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Load monthly startup expense data (cloud, SaaS, marketing)
2. Learn normal spending patterns from historical data
3. Detect months with unusually high total costs
4. Explain anomalies by comparing them to recent spending averages

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Statistical anomaly detection

---

## 📊 Example Insight

This explanation helps founders immediately understand when and how spending changed,
without digging through raw numbers.

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure `startup_costs.csv` is in the same folder as the Python file
3. Run the script:

```bash
python finops_step2.py
