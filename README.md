# AI-Powered FinOps Cost Anomaly Detection

## 📌 Problem
Startups often realize too late that their spending is increasing and their runway is shrinking.
Cloud costs, SaaS tools, and marketing spend can quietly grow month by month without clear warnings.

Founders need an early signal when spending becomes unusual — before it becomes dangerous.

---

## 💡 Solution
This project builds an AI-powered FinOps system that learns normal startup spending behavior
and automatically detects unusual cost anomalies.

Instead of just showing numbers, the system explains why a cost spike happened in
clear, human-readable language.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Monthly burn rate calculation
- Cost trend visualization
- Automatic cost anomaly detection
- Plain-English AI explanations for spending spikes

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Load monthly startup expense data (cloud, SaaS, marketing)
2. Learn normal spending patterns from historical data
3. Detect months with unusually high total costs
4. Explain anomalies by comparing them to recent spending averages

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Statistical anomaly detection

---

## 📊 Example Insight

In 2023-04, total costs increased by 67.6% compared to the previous 3-month average.


This explanation helps founders immediately understand when and how spending changed,
without digging through raw numbers.

## ▶️ How to Run
## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure `startup_costs.csv` is in the same folder as the Python file
3. Run the script:

```bash
python finops_step2.py

⚠️ Important:
- Keep the `##`
- Keep the numbers `1. 2. 3.`
- Keep the triple backticks ``` above and below the command

## ✅ How you’ll know it’s fixed

After saving, you should see:
- **▶️ How to Run** as a proper heading
- A **numbered list**
- `python finops_step2.py` inside a **gray code box**
- The **Example Insight gray box still intact**

If you see **two gray boxes** (one for Example Insight, one for How to Run command) → ✅ PERFECT.

### One-line reassurance
You didn’t mess up the README — you just missed **one Markdown pattern**. That’s normal.

Reply with:
👉 **fixed now**  
or  
👉 **still looks odd** (paste just the “How to Run” part and I’ll correct it)
